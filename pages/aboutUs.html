    <p>In 1862, Stephen Taylor and Anthony Harrow were two wealth managers in Chicago's metropolis area and had found the services industry lacked the quality schemes they had previously encountered.</p>
    <p>They set out with one mission - to envigourate a failing commonwealth and shake up aspects from inside</p>
    <p>With this in mind they established Taylor & Harrow Associates three years later in 1865 occupying a small office in the Old Fruit Exchange Square.</p>
    <p>Some 150 years later, Taylor & Harrow are now one of the most established practices in the midwest, offering exceptional service to clients.</p>
